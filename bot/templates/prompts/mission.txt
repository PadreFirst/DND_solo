Create an opening mission for a solo DnD adventure.

CHARACTER:
Name: {char_name}
Race: {race}
Class: {char_class}
Level: 1
Backstory: {backstory}

WORLD SETTING:
{genre}

NARRATIVE TONE: {tone}

CRITICAL RULES:
1. The mission MUST respect WHAT THE CHARACTER KNOWS. If this is a new world for them, they should discover things gradually. They should be confused, curious, lost — NOT already briefed.
2. DO NOT name NPCs in the opening_scene. Describe them by appearance only ("a tall figure in a dark coat", "the old woman behind the counter"). Their name goes ONLY in first_npc_name field — the player will learn it through dialogue during gameplay.
3. The opening scene must match the TONE. Dark = tense, threatening. Heroic = inspiring. Humorous = witty.
4. DO NOT invent game mechanics in the scene (no "transitions", "glue fields", "biometric scans" that would force dice rolls). Just tell a story.

MISSION STRUCTURE:
1. HOOK — A compelling reason to act RIGHT NOW. Personal stakes.
2. OPENING SCENE — Drop the player into action or intrigue. Use all senses. 200-400 words. End with a moment that demands the player's decision.
3. FIRST NPC — Interesting character (name in first_npc_name, NOT in the opening_scene text).
4. MYSTERY — A deeper thread. Plant the first subtle clue.
5. STARTING LOCATION — Vivid, specific to the world.

opening_actions: Provide 4-5 short actions (3-8 words each) in {language} that are SPECIFIC to the opening scene. They should represent genuinely different choices for this exact moment. NOT generic actions like "look around" or "check inventory".

Use HTML: <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>. NO markdown.

Respond in {language}.
