Create an opening mission for a solo DnD adventure.

CHARACTER:
Name: {char_name}
Race: {race}
Class: {char_class}
Level: 1
Backstory: {backstory}

WORLD SETTING:
{genre}

NARRATIVE TONE: {tone}

CRITICAL RULES:
1. The mission MUST respect WHAT THE CHARACTER KNOWS. If this is a new world for them, they should discover things gradually. They should be confused, curious, lost — NOT already briefed.
2. DO NOT name NPCs in the opening_scene. Describe them by appearance only ("a tall figure in a dark coat", "the old woman behind the counter"). Their name goes ONLY in first_npc_name field — the player will learn it through dialogue during gameplay.
3. The opening scene must match the TONE. Dark = tense, threatening. Heroic = inspiring. Humorous = witty.
4. DO NOT invent game mechanics in the scene (no "transitions", "glue fields", "biometric scans" that would force dice rolls). Just tell a story.

MISSION STRUCTURE:
1. HOOK — A compelling reason to act RIGHT NOW. Personal stakes.
2. OPENING SCENE — Drop the player into action or intrigue. 100-200 words MAX. This is a CHAT, not a novel. Set the mood, one vivid detail, one hook. End with a moment that demands the player's decision.
3. FIRST NPC — Interesting character (name in first_npc_name, NOT in the opening_scene text).
4. MYSTERY — A deeper thread. Plant the first subtle clue.
5. STARTING LOCATION — Vivid, specific to the world.
6. STARTING LOCATION DESCRIPTION — Fill starting_location_description with 2-3 sentences describing the physical space:
   - Layout: room size, shape, what's around
   - Exits: doors, windows, hatches, corridors, vents — and where they lead
   - Interactive objects: consoles, crates, cover, machinery, containers, furniture
   - Hazards/opportunities: gas canisters, electrical panels, toxic materials, fire
   The player uses this to make TACTICAL decisions. "Workshop" tells them nothing. "Cramped workshop, 4×6m, one blast door (locked), ventilation shaft in ceiling, shelves with droid parts, oil drums near the wall" — that's useful.

opening_actions: Provide 4-5 short actions (3-8 words each) in {language} that are SPECIFIC to the opening scene. They should represent genuinely different choices for this exact moment. NOT generic actions like "look around" or "check inventory".

CURRENCY:
- currency_name: Set the world-appropriate currency name in {language}. Examples: "золотые монеты" (fantasy), "имперские кредиты" (Star Wars), "теневые рубли" (modern Russia underworld), "рупии" (exotic), "нуйены" (cyberpunk), "кроны" (Witcher). Use a short, immersive name that fits the world.
- starting_gold: Set the starting money amount appropriate for the world's economy scale. Fantasy: 10-50. Sci-fi: 200-1000. Modern: 1000-10000. The number should FEEL right for the setting — a bounty hunter with 500 credits feels different from a peasant with 10 gold.
