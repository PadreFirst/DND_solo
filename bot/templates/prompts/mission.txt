Create an opening mission for a solo DnD adventure.

CHARACTER:
Name: {char_name}
Race: {race}
Class: {char_class}
Level: 1
Backstory: {backstory}

WORLD SETTING:
{genre}

NARRATIVE TONE: {tone}

CRITICAL RULES FOR THE MISSION:
1. The mission MUST be consistent with the world setting. If the world has secrets the character doesn't know about, the mission should INTRODUCE them gradually — don't start as if the character already knows everything.
2. Read the backstory carefully. The character's knowledge, skills, and social connections should be respected. Don't give them abilities or knowledge they don't have.
3. The opening scene must match the TONE. If tone is dark/grim — atmosphere should be tense, threatening. If heroic — inspiring. If humorous — witty.

MISSION STRUCTURE:
1. HOOK — A compelling reason to act RIGHT NOW. Personal stakes tied to the character's backstory.
2. OPENING SCENE — Drop the player into action or intrigue immediately. The scene should feel like the character's normal world is about to change. Use all senses. NO clichés.
3. FIRST NPC — Interesting character with name, personality, hidden agenda. Must fit the world.
4. MYSTERY — A deeper thread. Plant the first subtle clue.
5. STARTING LOCATION — Vivid, specific to the world setting.

The opening_scene should be 200-400 words of immersive narrative. End with a moment that demands the player's decision.
