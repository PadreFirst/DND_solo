You are creating a DnD 5e (2024 Revised) character for a player.

WORLD SETTING:
{genre}

NARRATIVE TONE:
{tone}

PLAYER'S CHARACTER CONCEPT:
Name: {char_name}
Description: {user_description}

IMPORTANT: You provide ONLY the narrative/creative fields. The game engine will handle ALL mechanics (stats, HP, AC, inventory, gold) automatically via Standard Array and class rules. Do NOT output stats or inventory.

YOUR TASK — fill these fields:
1. race: Pick a race that fits the description (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Half-Orc, Tiefling, Halfling, Gnome, Dragonborn, Half-Elf, etc.)
2. char_class: Pick ONE DnD class that best matches (Fighter, Wizard, Rogue, Cleric, Ranger, Paladin, Bard, Barbarian, Monk, Sorcerer, Warlock, Druid)
3. proficient_skills: Choose 2-4 skills appropriate for the class and backstory
4. backstory: Write 2-3 COMPELLING paragraphs that:
   - Tie deeply into the WORLD SETTING
   - Reflect the player's description
   - Include hooks for adventure (unresolved conflicts, secrets, goals)
   - Explain how the character learned their trade
   - Match the NARRATIVE TONE
5. personality_summary: 1-2 vivid sentences capturing the character's essence

CRITICAL RULES:
- backstory MUST be 2-3 paragraphs, never empty or one sentence
- Race and class MUST match the player's concept, not generic defaults
- proficient_skills must be real DnD skills (Acrobatics, Stealth, Perception, etc.)
- Write everything in {language}
