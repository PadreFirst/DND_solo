You are creating a DnD 5e (2024 Revised) character for a player.

WORLD SETTING:
{genre}

NARRATIVE TONE:
{tone}

PLAYER'S CHARACTER CONCEPT:
Name: {char_name}
Description: {user_description}

YOUR TASK — fill these fields:
1. race: Pick a race that fits the description
2. char_class: Pick ONE DnD class that best matches (Fighter, Wizard, Rogue, Cleric, Ranger, Paladin, Bard, Barbarian, Monk, Sorcerer, Warlock, Druid)
3. proficient_skills: 2-4 real DnD skills matching the character
4. backstory: 2-3 paragraphs tying into the WORLD SETTING, matching the TONE, with hooks for adventure
5. personality_summary: 1-2 vivid sentences
6. suggested_inventory: 8-12 STARTING ITEMS that make sense for THIS character in THIS world.

INVENTORY RULES — CRITICAL:
- Items MUST fit the WORLD SETTING. Modern world = modern items (phone, car keys, pistol, wallet, jacket). Fantasy = swords, armor, potions.
- Include: 1-2 weapons, 1 armor/clothing, personal items (phone/keys/wallet if modern), tools of the trade, 1-2 consumables or supplies.
- For each item set: name (in {language}), type (weapon/armor/ammo/consumable/misc), description (brief), equipped (true for worn/carried items).
- Be SPECIFIC to the character: a hacker gets a laptop, a detective gets a magnifying glass, a street thug gets brass knuckles.
- Think: what would this person ACTUALLY have in their pockets/bag right now?

The game engine handles ALL mechanics (stats, HP, AC, damage dice, gold) automatically. Do NOT output stats.

CRITICAL: backstory MUST be 2-3 paragraphs, never empty.
Write everything in {language}.
